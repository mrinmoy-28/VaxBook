# Problem Statement — Hospital Vaccine Search & Slot Booking

## Problem
Citizens often struggle to identify nearby hospitals offering specific vaccines, understand daily availability, compare costs, and book slots without delays or overbooking.

## Objective
Build a web application that helps users:
- Find hospitals offering vaccines
- Check daily slot availability
- View vaccine cost
- Book a slot

Hospital/admin users should be able to manage vaccines, prices, and daily capacity.

## User Capabilities

### Citizen / Patient
- Search hospitals by city / pincode / name
- Filter by vaccine type and price
- View availability day-by-day (today, tomorrow, upcoming days)
- See cost per vaccine per hospital
- Book a vaccine slot and receive a confirmation
- View, modify or cancel existing bookings

### Hospital / Admin
- Add and update hospital details
- Define vaccines offered and cost per dose
- Set daily slot capacity (date-based)
- View bookings for a given day

## Core Expectations
- Daily availability tracking (slots vary per date)
- **No overbooking** — once slots are filled, booking should fail gracefully
- **Price transparency** — show and **lock price at booking time**
- Persistent data storage (users, hospitals, vaccines, bookings)

## Key Features to Demonstrate Full-Stack Skills
- Search & filter experience (UX matters)
- Clean backend logic for availability & booking
- Proper data modeling for hospitals, vaccines, slots, bookings
- Role separation (user vs admin)
- Basic validations (date, availability, duplicate booking)
